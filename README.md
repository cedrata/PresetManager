# PresetManager
## Infos
Basic preset manager template for JUCE.

The aim of this project is to provide a simple preset manamager implementation to add in every project if needed.

## Run
At the moment runs only under mac, missing paths for windows, feel free to add.
To run this example on MacOS the first thing to do is create a directory in "/Library/Application Support" named "CedrataDSP" with all rights to read and write, inside of it a directory "PresetManager" must be created.

## TODOs
It is not completed yet but soon will be. At the moment is missing the delete preset handler, then show user when current preset has been chaned.
STANDBY! Just forked the repo at [this link](https://github.com/TheAudioProgrammer/jucePresetManagement/tree/master/Source), when i started this repo I didn't find anything. But now thath the liked repo exists (and done far better than mine) i will implement what i think is missing in my opinion.
