# PresetManager
## Infos
Basic preset manager template for JUCE.

The aim of this project is to provide a simple preset manamager implementation to add in every project if needed.

## Run
At the moment runs only under mac, missing paths for windows, feel free to add.
To run this example on MacOS the first thing to do is create a directory in "/Library/Application Support" named "CedrataDSP" with all rights to read and write, inside of it a directory "PresetManager" must be created.

## TODOs
It is not completed yet but soon will be. At the moment is missing the delete preset handler, then show user when current preset has been chaned.
